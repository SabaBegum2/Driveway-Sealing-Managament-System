                    change work dates
                Quit (Cancel) Order

                Reject request + note
                Counter Proposal:

                    Time window (begin-end)
            Quit (cancel) order

    2. Check work orders (content and status)
            If status == completed
                Generate Bill:
                    State work done
                    Cost
                    Optional Discount
