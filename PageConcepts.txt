            View bill(s):
                Pay bill with credit_card_info:

                    change work dates
                Quit (Cancel) Order


DAVID SMITH DASHBOARD:
    1. Check all incoming requests (content, responses, status)
            Respond:
                Reject request + note
                Counter Proposal:
                    Price
                    Time window (begin-end)
            Quit (cancel) order

    2. Check work orders (content and status)
            If status == completed
                Generate Bill:
                    State work done
                    Cost
                    Optional Discount
                    Optional note

    3. Check all bills (content and status)
            Respond to most recent response of quote and bill




Client should be able to:
    - Create a new quote request + images
    - View their quote history
        ** Note that replies should only be from most recent responses
        - see requests
        - accept quote with David's added start/end (triggers work order)
        - counter the new price or counter the dates + new note
        - reject quote
    - View work orders
    - View invoices
        - Pay with CC on file (return with a date of payment)
        - Dispute bill with a note complaint


David should be able to:
    - Preview all clients in DB
        + Preview those who registered but never requested a quote
    - New or client revised quotes:
        - Resend new quote with start + end dates
            - counter initial price proposal or keep it
        - Reject it + note with reason
        + Clients with 3+ requests to David but no follow-up
    - See work orders
        - Change work order status to "completed" (triggers an invoice)
        + "List all the AGREED quotes in this month" (trigger was used for this; this whole table is "accepted")
        + List largest driveway(s) (only on 'completed' orders? "...that David ever worked")
    - See bills
        - view all
        - reply  (if generated 7 days ago)
        + search: client with most orders completed (show more if there's a tie)
        + search: list all unpaid bills after 7 days of dateCreated
        + search: list all overdue bills (after 7 days) for clients who never paid their bill(s)
        + search: list all clients who paid their bills within 24 hrs of being created
